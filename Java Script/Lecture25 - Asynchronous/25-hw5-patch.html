      <h1>The PATCH method</h1>
      <h3>
        The PATCH method is very similar to the PUT method because it also modifies an existing 
        resource. The difference is that for the PUT method, the request body contains the 
        complete new version, whereas for the PATCH method, the request body only needs to 
        contain the specific changes to the resource, specifically a set of instructions 
        describing how that resource should be changed, and the API service will create a new 
        version according to that instruction.
